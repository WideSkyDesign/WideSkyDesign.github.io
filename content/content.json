					"Intro": "The sand flats and shoreline of the Fitties are home to many bird species. Some live there all year round, some are passing through. They are sometimes hard to spot, but can you tell them from their birdsong? Match the bird to the correct call. Touch a bird call to hear the sound. Drag and drop the bird call onto the bird to make a guess. ",
